A self-organizing map is a sort of artificial neural network, often known as a Kohonen map or SOM, and was influenced by 1970s neural systemsâ€™ biological models. It employs an unsupervised learning methodology and uses a competitive learning algorithm to train its network. To minimize complex issues for straightforward interpretation, SOM is utilized for mapping and clustering (or dimensionality reduction) procedures to map multidimensional data onto lower-dimensional spaces. The output layer and the input layer are the two layers that make up the SOM. This is also known as the Kohonen Map. Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning (such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.

## CREDIT CARD APPLICATIONS DATASET
### DATASET
The dataset is called Credit Card Applications dataset. It containes over 15 columns and 690 rows, all in csv format. The columns are already encoded and probably contain information that may help the model to predict which of them represents fraud.

### PROBLEM
Given a dataset with a total of 15 dimensions and 690 records in it, predict whether or not our the credit card represents fraudulent transaction or not.

### OBJECTIVE
To develop a self organizing map that takes into account all given data and predicts whether or not the credit card is associated with fraud.

### MOTIVATION
To learn and implement Self Organizing Map using a hands-on approach.
