# Deep-Learning-Models
A repository containing various deep learning models implemented for tackling different problems.

Deep learning is an iterative approach to artificial intelligence (AI) that stacks machine learning algorithms in a hierarchy of increasing complexity and abstraction. Each deep learning level is created with knowledge gained from the preceding layer of the hierarchy.

The first layer of a deep image recognition algorithm, for example, might focus on learning about color patterns in training data, while the next layer focuses on shapes. Eventually, the hierarchy will have layers that focuses on various combinations of colors and shapes, with the top layer focusing on the actual object being recognized.

This repository is an attempt to model different deep learning models and get a hands-on experience in handling them. The repository contains 7 different deep learning models comprising of Artificial Neural Networks,
